Abstract
Global Production Networks and Industrial Policy: A Multi-Country Structural Approach

The use of tariffs and subsidies is increasingly prevalent in today’s economic and political context. In a highly inter-connected global economy, understanding the implications for trade and welfare is a first-order priority. In this paper, I contribute to the discussion by characterizing optimal policy under cooperative and uncooperative political frameworks using a structural model of global production networks. I extend a structural model of industrial policy and production networks (Liu, 2019) to include international trade in intermediate and final goods. The policy decisions, including domestic production subsidies and import tariffs, are simultaneously motivated by terms-of-trade effects and distortion correction. The model captures the propagation of these policies through global production network linkages, as informed by input-output tables from the OECD. Using this framework, I begin by demonstrating the need to examine industrial and trade policy jointly. I then characterize optimal policy in the case with, and without, international cooperation. Finally, I compare global and national welfare under each scenario to answer the question “who, if anyone, wins in a trade war?”.
